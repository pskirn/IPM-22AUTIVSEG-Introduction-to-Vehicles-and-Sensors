1. What is the bandwidth required (bytes per second transferred) for the Velodyne VLP-16 LIDAR?

2. The Velodyne VLP-16 LIDAR can give how many points (laser beams) horizontally and vertically for a 40cm wide and 180 tall pedestrian at a 20m and 100m distance? Calculate the values for the maximum resolution (lowest rotation speed) and for the lowest resolution (maximum rotation speed)!

You can find the Velodyne VLP-16 datasheet here.(https://www.amtechs.co.jp/product/VLP-16-Puck.pdf)

Submit not only the results but also the calculation you used!
