The IMU is attached to the car (x is the longitudinal, y is the lateral direction, no z height is used).

Draw the acceleration of the x and y-axis (longitudinal and lateral) versus time graphs, and the circular (angular) velocity versus time graph. The acceleration and breaking is constant. 

(You can draw a velocity graph also.)

Upload the three graphs.
