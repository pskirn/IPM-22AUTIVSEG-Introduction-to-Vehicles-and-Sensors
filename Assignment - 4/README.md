1. What is the (approximative) bandwidth required (bytes per second transferred) for a typical autonomous/self-driving vehicle camera system? (For example, all the cameras mounted on a Tesla, Waymo or others).

2. What is the size of a pixel at 100 meter distance, how many pixels horizontally and vertically are a 40cm wide and 180cm tall pedestrian at a 20m, and at 100m distance for a camera sensor with various optics (6mm, 3.7mm and 25mm focal lengths)?

The camera sensor is MV-CA020-20GC (https://www.hikvisionweb.com/product/camera/gige/mv-ca020-20gc/.)  using optical lens SV-0614H (https://www.rmaelectronics.com/vs-technology-sv-0614h/.), LM3JC10M ((https://www.rmaelectronics.com/kowa-lm3jc10m/))  

 

The parameters of the camera (sensor):

sensor size is 2/3"

resolution: 1920 Ã— 1200pixel

max frame rate ("frequency") is 52.7 fps (frames per second)

Parameters of the optical lens:

focal lengths: 6mm, 3.7mm and 25mm.

You can use an online "sensor, focal length -> field of view calculator" such as for example https://www.kowa-lenses.com/en/lens-calculator (Links to an external site.) )
