Decode the GPS positions from the two files given in the NMEA 0183 ((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183).) ASCII format.

Look at output0.nmea and find the GPS coordinates in the file. Where are those points?
Decode output1.nmea . You can use decoders. What is the path defined by the GPS coordinates?
