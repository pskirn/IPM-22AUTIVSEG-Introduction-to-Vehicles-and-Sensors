SAE Standard J3016 defines the levels of driving automation. Choose an existing (commercial or experimental) vehicle and analyze and justify its level of automation. In your analysis, provide a detailed description of the automated driving system (ADS) used in the vehicle. Address the following questions:

What are the key functionalities of the selected vehicle?
What automated driving features have been implemented in the vehicle?
According to SAE J3016, to what level of driving automation does the vehicle correspond?
What is the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of the vehicle's automated driving system?
