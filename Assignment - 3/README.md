Practical Sensor Measurement Lab Exercise
Objective: To understand and evaluate the performance of a sensor commonly used in autonomous vehicle systems through hands-on experiments.

Instructions:
Sensor Selection
Select one of the following sensor (types):

Infrared Distance Sensor
RGB-D Sensor
LiDAR Sensor
Data Sheet Analysis
Find and review the datasheet for the selected sensor. Focus on key specifications such as:

Range
Resolution
Measurement accuracy
Operating conditions
Parameter Identification
Identify the most important parameters of the sensor. Determine how these parameters impact the sensor's ability to provide accurate and reliable measurements. Consider:

How these parameters relate to the sensor’s performance
Which parameters are quantifiable through experiments
Experimental Design
Design an experimental setup to quantify the performance of the sensor. In your design, specify:

The controlled variables (e.g., distance, angle, ambient light)
The sensor placement and environmental conditions
The method for recording sensor output
Hypotheses about the sensor’s performance based on its datasheet
Data Collection
Implement the designed experiment using the selected sensor and collect measurement data. Ensure to:

Document the setup and procedure clearly
Record multiple measurements for better accuracy and reliability
Include details on any challenges or unexpected results
Data Evaluation
Analyze the collected data. Evaluate the sensor based on the experimental results by:

Comparing measured values to the expected performance in the datasheet
Quantifying the sensor’s accuracy, range, resolution, and response to varying conditions
Identifying any limitations or deviations from the datasheet
Conclusion
Summarize your findings and discuss:

Whether the sensor met the expectations from the datasheet
Provide data to compare the sensor with other sensors (accuracy, precision)
Potential improvements or alternative configurations for the sensor
Real-world applications where the sensor would be most effective or limited
